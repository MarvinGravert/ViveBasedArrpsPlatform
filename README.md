# Input and Tracking System for Augmented Reality-assisted Robot Programming

This repository contains the code associated with the paper: "Input and Tracking System for Augmented Reality-assisted Robot Programming".

An input and tracking system based on the VIVE Lighthouse technology that can act as a basis for "Augmented reality robot programming systems" (ARRPS) is realized.

In the video it is shown that a person can program a robot using the VIVE controllers while being shown the programmed path using the Hololens.
